Allow user to compare the effectiveness of various items by distilling effects into the following categories:

Effective Health


Vitality = (Base vit + VitFromItems) * sum(vitality multipliers)

Base Health:
If (char.level < 35) {
	VIT * 10;
} 
else {
	VIT * (char.level - 10);
}

Total Health = baseHealth * sum(lifeMultipliers)
